- You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
	input:	SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
	output:	1|4|Really nice chapel!|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt
			2|5|Great towing service!|2|2|2|Amir's Towing|2|Mandy|Kaling
			3|2|Too crowded and the music sucks|3|3|3|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Angela|Jolie

- There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
	input:	SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
	output:	Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|Really nice chapel!
			Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|5|Great towing service!
			Angela|Jolie|The Beagle Nightclub|2|Too crowded and the music sucks

- How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
	input:	SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name="The Beagle Nightclub";
	output:	3|2|Too crowded and the music sucks|3|3|3|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Angela|Jolie
