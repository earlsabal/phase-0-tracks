# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is where changes in a file or files within a repository are recorded and saved as they are worked on over time.  It is useful, because you can look back on older versions if problems occur and compare codes to fix any  mistakes or bugs that are made.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is basically the storage of commits made on a repository. The default or original branch is called the master branch and is essentially the main copy of a repository. You can create new branches that you can work on if you wanted to add a feature or make changes on a project.  You would use branches, because adding or changing code to only the original branch could be dangerous and could possibly break or mess up a program.  So using new branches you can safely edit/add code and make them effective after it is done and working, or simply discard it if necessary.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is the recorded change in a repository. So if a file or files were added/updated a commit would store that information with a message. A good commit message would contain specific information on what codes or features were changed or added.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two different changes are made in two different branches and as a result, when you try to merge the two branches, git does not know which change to make.
